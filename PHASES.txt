Phase 0: Foundation & Setup (Week 1)
This is the most critical phase. Rushing here will cause pain later.

Clarify Your "Why": Re-read your objectives. The core value is speed and consistency. Every technical decision should be measured against this.

Set Up Your Project Hub: Create your Notion/Confluence space. Create sections for:

Vision & Objectives: Paste your refined vision here.

API Documentation: Links to the docs for your chosen tools.

Architecture Diagrams: You'll create these.

Weekly Goals & Progress: Be transparent.

Choose Your Specific Tools (for MVP): You can't build for "any SIEM" in 8 weeks. You must pick one of each to start.

SIEM: Splunk (free dev license) or Elastic SIEM (free tier). Splunk has a more straightforward API for beginners.

EDR: CrowdStrike or SentinelOne. Check which has a better free trial/dev program. Their APIs are powerful but complex.

Firewall: Palo Alto Networks has an excellent API. pfSense is a free alternative but its API might be less polished.

Credentials: For MVP, simulating a credential reset via a Python script is safer than touching AD/LDAP directly.

Architecture Diagram: Draw this out. It creates a shared language for your team.

Access the APIs:

Sign up for developer accounts/trials for your chosen tools.

Get API keys.

Do not code anything yet. Use Postman or curl to manually send test requests to each API. Can you authenticate? Can you fetch an alert? Can you isolate an endpoint? This hands-on testing is invaluable.

Phase 1: The Manual Spine (Weeks 2-3)
Goal: Create a system where a human (you) can manually approve and trigger actions. The automation is fake, but the data flow is real.

Backend (FastAPI):

Set up a basic FastAPI server.

Create a /webhook endpoint that accepts POST requests from your SIEM. This endpoint should just parse the incoming JSON alert and print it to the console. Use a tool like ngrok to expose your local server to the internet so the SIEM can send the webhook.

Create a simple in-memory structure (a list) to store "incidents".

Database (PostgreSQL):

Set up a local Postgres instance.

Create a single table: incidents.

id, received_at, siem_alert_data (JSONB), status (detected, triaging, action_taken, resolved), actions_taken (JSONB)

Frontend (React):

Create a simple React app with create-react-app.

Create one component: an "Incident Table" that fetches the list of incidents from your FastAPI backend and displays them in a table.

The "Human-in-the-Loop":

In your React table, add a button next to each incident: "Execute Response".

Clicking this button should call your FastAPI backend.

The backend should then manually (using the requests library) call the EDR API to isolate the endpoint and the Firewall API to block the IP. You are the "agent" right now.

Congratulations: You now have a working spine. Data flows from SIEM -> Your App -> Dashboard. Commands flow from Dashboard -> Your App -> External Tools.

Phase 2: Introducing Agentic AI with Autogen (Week 4)
Goal: Replace yourself (the human click) with a simple automated rule, and then layer Autogen on top for reasoning.

Dumb Automation First:

Modify your /webhook endpoint. Instead of just storing the incident, add a simple rule: if alert.severity == 'critical': trigger_response().

trigger_response() will automatically call the EDR and Firewall APIs. THIS IS DANGEROUS. Only do this in a lab environment with fake data.

You now have a basic, dumb SOAR playbook.

Integrate Autogen for Triage:

Do not let Autogen make final decisions yet. Use it as an "Assistant Agent".

Set up an Autogen agent that has the following system prompt:

"You are a SOC triage specialist. Analyze the following SIEM alert and determine if it is likely to be ransomware. Consider the severity, the endpoint name, and the description. Respond ONLY with a JSON object containing two keys: confidence: (a number between 0-1) and reason: (a short explanation)."

When a new alert comes in, your FastAPI backend will pass the alert JSON to this Autogen agent.

The agent's response (confidence score) is stored in the incidents table.

Now, change your rule: if agent_confidence > 0.8: trigger_response().

Dashboard Upgrade: Add the agent's confidence and reason fields to the React dashboard. This is your "reasoning trace".

Phase 3: Orchestration & Resilience (Weeks 5-6)
Goal: Make the workflow robust and auditable.

State Management: Your backend needs to manage the state of each incident carefully (detected -> triaging -> firewall_blocked -> endpoint_isolated -> complete). If an API call fails, the state should reflect that.

Audit Logging: Every API call you make to an external tool (EDR, Firewall) must be logged in detail in your database. Who (which agent), what, when, and what the response was.

Rollback/Override: Implement endpoints in FastAPI to:

POST /incident/<id>/override - To stop an automated response.

POST /incident/<id>/rollback - To un-isolate an endpoint or unblock an IP. This is complex, so for MVP, just focus on the "override" to stop automation.

Dashboard: Build out the incident detail view with a timeline that shows the state changes and logged actions.

Phase 4: Security & Polish (Week 7)
Goal: Harden the application for demo.

Authentication: Add a simple login to your React app. FastAPI has good OAuth2 libraries.

Secrets Management: Move all API keys out of your code and into environment variables or a .env file.

Error Handling: Wrap all your API calls in try-catch blocks. Log errors gracefully.

Testing: Write a script that generates a fake "ransomware alert" and posts it to your /webhook endpoint. Does the whole chain work?

Phase 5: Review & Launch (Week 8)
Goal: Demonstrate value to your stakeholders.

Demo Script: Write a script for your demo. "Here is our dashboard. We simulate an alert... (trigger the test alert)... watch as it automatically appears... the AI agent assigns a 0.95 confidence... and now the system has automatically isolated the endpoint and blocked the IP. Here is the audit log."

Gather Feedback: What worries the SOC Manager? What extra info does the Analyst need? This feedback is fuel for your next version.
